  Hi, my name is Holger and I am a Munich based developer specializing in Virtual Reality and stereoscopic rendering.
  Are you planning to port your existing game or experience to Virtual Reality? I can help you!

  I have been involved in several successful community-driven VR ports for classic games and understand the challenges involved.
  Rendering games in VR is a performance-critical task that requires special considerations to make it work well. Techniques like
  instanced and multiview stereo rendering and (fixed) foveated rendering can help reduce the performance overhead. Additionally,
  it is crucial to understand the essential gameplay features that must be implemented to make VR gamers happy.

  If you think you can benefit from my experience, don't hesitate to contact me!

          Half Life 2: VR is a third-party modification of the 2004 PC gaming classic by Valve Software, which adds full Virtual Reality support to the original game.

          The project was originally started over a decade ago in the early days of Oculus.
          It successfully passed Steam greenlight in 2017, but then ran into trouble and was
          all but abandoned. I joined the project in July 2021 as part of an influx of new
          team members to revive it and finally get it out of the door. As the lead developer,
          I made sure to keep the project focussed on the essentials and slowly transform it
          into a playable and enjoyable experience. The project entered a private beta test phase
          in May 2022 and launched publically in September 2022 on Steam. It was met with an
          overwhelmingly positive reception by the VR community.
          
          Built on the Source 2013 SDK and using OpenVR and a customized dxvk build to implement
          the VR rendering.

          Far Cry VR transforms the classic 2004 shooter into a full virtual reality experience with motion controls.

          With the help of the Far Cry Mod SDK, I created a total conversion of the game to make it
          a native VR experience. Full stereoscopic VR rendering combined with motion controller support
          lets players experience Jack Carver's visit to Cabatu from a whole new perspective.

          Crysis VR is a work-in-progress Virtual Reality adaptation of the notorious 2007 shooter.

          I implemented stereoscopic rendering and basic motion controller support that allow you to
          experience this still gorgeous game in glorious VR.
          
          Built on the Crysis Mod SDK, it incorporates a D3D10 to D3D11 bridge to bring the rendered
          images to the OpenXR runtime.

          The Dark Mod is a free community-developed stealth game in the spirit of the Thief series.
          I have created a VR adaptation that currently allows the game to be played as a seated
          keyboard+mouse experience in virtual reality, with motion controller support in the works.
          In the process, I have contributed many improvements to the game's renderer to make its performance
          meet the needs of VR rendering. Working on this project has taught me most of what I know about
          3D rendering and VR, specifically knowledge in OpenGL, OpenVR and OpenXR.

          This tool can inject upscaling and fixed foveated rendering into existing VR games, giving
          users tools to improve rendering performance with an acceptable loss of visual fidelity.
          The tool works by injecting into D3D11 and VR render calls.
